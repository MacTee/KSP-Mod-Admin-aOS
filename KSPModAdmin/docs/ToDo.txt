//// BUGS
/////////////////////
- ModName changes after Mod update.
- AVC Plugin - Problem when a mod archive contains multiple version files.
- Some mods have additional folders that normally doesn't install. 
  It can be folders with alternative data, manuals, etc. For examples see Planet Shine or UniversalStorage [TAC PACK]. 
  Usually Mod Admin can't detect installation path for them and shows warning. When I update this mods, Mod Admin shows warning again for every root node 
  without installation path. I update in "Copy checked state" mode.


//// Known Issues
/////////////////////
- I dunno if it's a KSMPA-problem or KSP, but trying to do Borderless Window (fullscreen resolution) with OpenGL forced throws a KSP-error :/
  Is it an error like "Couldn't switch to requested monitor resolution" ?
  If yes, this problem exists since KSP 1.0, especially with a multiple monitors environment. The work around is to add "-adapter 1" in the launch options, where "1" is the screen number. Maybe MacTee could add this option to KMA ?
- After i start KSP MA i get the following error message:
  "Unexpected runtime error: "An attempt was made to load an assembly from a network location which would have caused the assembly to be sandboxed...""
  This happens when windows has flaged the files of KSP MA as a web download.
  You have to allow access to following files HtmlAgilityPack.dll, KSPModAdmin.Core.dll, Newtonsoft.Json.dll, SharpCompress.dll and plugins/KSPModAdmin.Translation.Plugin.dll manualy by
  1. Right click the dll
  2. Chose properties
  3. Click "Unblock"

//// TODO
///////////////////// 

- Maybe its time for a force delete option. To delete folders which contain untracked files.

- Known KSP Path: Relative ksp path search (options/path) create a new dialog for this option.

- LINUX - Steam installs KSP to a hidden folder...
  Workaround: Create a link to the install directory and use that instead

- MONO:
  - TreeListView improvement -> Column Header draw and row offset ...
  - Plus/Minus of TreeViewAdv is misplaced.
  - "Please select Backup Folder" Label is invisible (lblSelectBackupPathFirst)
  - Button Text allignement...
  - Filter DropDown on Crafts Tab

- ModInfos are automatically added about add-ons where a valid version control site is detected. 
  That is great, however some information fields are not automatically filled (Author, Creation date, Change date). 
  I currently have add-ons checking with many different Version Control sites (GitHub, CurseForge, KSP Forum) 
  but with none those fields are filled.

- Overwrite button states are indistinguishable. It's hard to say, what mode it is in. May be CheckBox would be more visual?
  - Change ToolTip to display On/Off state?

- AVC Plugin version file support
  - Bug fix see BUGS above.
  
- ReadMe

- Restart destination detection.

- Revise of the English/German text
  - unify URL, link, site, page
  - spelling error
  - wording

- Don't load all languages into memory! 

- Tab to enable/disable plugins
  - Don't enable unknown plugins during loading.
  - Save known plugins (+ enable state) to AppConfig.
  - Remove known but not found plugins (or ask the user).

- Try loading old KSPModAdmin.cfg file if no new cfg file is available.
  -> For AppConfig and KSPConfig!
  
- Search in ModSelection.

- Implementation of a waffle iron !!! =)


//// SUGGESTIONS
/////////////////////

- It took me a long time to understand that unchecking a mod was not enough to disable it. And even longer to understand that "process mod" means reflecting the unchecked boxes to the actual game.
  It would be simple to correct : When clicking "Launch Kerbal", a popup could say "you have one or more mods that are not processed. Launch anyway?"

- CKAN package support (add as file or url) + CKAN repository browser
- PartEditor with ModulManager support
- 

- Perhaps you could add a launch option to start the game through Steam. Just using "steam://rungameid/220200" should work.
- Option to add files to an exclude list for mod install (like readme, txt, licenses ...)
- Compress for zipping.
- Add/Show Cancel button during Archive extraction 
  (think about what happens to the already extract or deleted files --> transaction?!)
